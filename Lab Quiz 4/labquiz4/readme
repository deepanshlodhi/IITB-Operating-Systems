Labquiz #4. 5th November 2018

1. labquiz4.pdf describes the lab statement.

2. task-master.pdf illustrates implementation details of different system 
   calls. 

3. Partial list of supporting variables and function declarations/definitions 
   are in proc.c, sysproc.c, user.h, syscall.h, and syscall.c

4. Since variables are proc.c, main logic of system calls can be implemented
   in proc.c (similar to fork).

5. Test cases are provided as source files test*.c and outputs are provided
   in the 'sample-outputs' directory. Additionally, testcases are also part
   of xv6 source.

6. The state of the stack on a function call is as follows,
   (Assuming stack grows from higher address to lower address)


            arg2
            arg1
      esp-> return addr
