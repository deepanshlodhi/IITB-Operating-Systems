p1c EXPLANATION
----------------------------

If the child process terminates earlier than the grandchild, then when the grandchild terminates - the SIGCHLD signal is sent to it's (previous) which we created is not alive, and hence the grandchild's termination is not printed.

In the other case, the SIGCHLD signals of grandchild and child reach the child and parent respectively and behave as expected.
